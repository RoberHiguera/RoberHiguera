### Hi, I'm Roberto 👨‍💻 

**BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE ANALYST** 

Detail-oriented and results-driven Business Intelligence Analyst with over a decade of experience spanning financial auditing and business intelligence. From my early days as an Auditor to my current role as a Business Intelligence, I've cultivated expertise in data collection, data analysis, data visualization, data modeling, and forecasting, consistently generating actionable insights to inform strategic decision-making. Proficient in managing financial cycles and conducting stewardship reporting, I uphold data quality and governance standards to drive organizational excellence.

Throughout my career journey, I've led audit projects, managed intricate financial data, and provided invaluable insights into financial processes at recognized firms like BDO and EY. In my recent role as a Global Business Analyst at ExxonMobil, I gained a holistic view of financial stewardship, managing complex budget cycles, and delivering actionable insights through dynamic presentations and intuitive dashboards.
